# ODS-Simulator
This repo contains the MATLAB programs written in support of the Mater's thesis, "Development and Validation of Guidance, Navigation, and Control Strategies for CubeSat Earth Observation Missions" written by Elijah Vautour. The orbit determination system (ODS) simulator is a realistic simulation environment to design and test ODS algorithms.
